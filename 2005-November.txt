Subject: [Ziahttpd-developers] New folder on CVS
Message-ID: <BAY102-F2712D112DDB366EA35A85BE66E0@phx.gbl>

I have added a new folder on the CVS, now I don't have to use my rack at 
home.
And you can see my progression with the TODO.txt file. I have a lot of work 
to do tomorrow, but I know it's possible if I do it at home.
The implemented version of ConfManager is usable, but it's easier and faster 
to dev in an independant project for me.
This class is not very hard but i need to be concentrate for do it.

I see you tomorow (I have a meeting at school)

bye

Message-ID: <6c660c750511031726i2ef5b7bby77e94b76bb92c36c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
 I ask some people who already passed theur "soutenance fiche projet". (like
the groupe of crivis_s). They made average 9-10 pages for their fiche projet
(c'est juste pour indiciation.. ca veut pas forcement dire qqch... bref)
 He told me (dolean_j) that they didn't give them a grade for the ZIA
project, but they gave a mark for their fiche project !!!
 I think that my fiche projet is quite good, isn't it ? :)
 But something that he told me was very important.... We must do a Gantt's
diagramm. (very appreciated ! ...)
And of course, the digramm of our class (like doxygen doing to the xmlLib
.... very cool) and the diagramm of sequence (not complicated, i noted some
example in the UML class)
 So I hoped that everybody put the comment at the end of your file (the last
time, i have juste found the tinyxml lib in doxygen (logical ^^))
 Then, we have juste to print the documentation created by doxygen...not all
of course, but an important part (qd m?me)
 ++ good night ;)
 PS: I will be at school saturday (and sunday)... In all manner, i will see
texane this week-end... but don't forget to comment your CLASS and METHODs.
 ZZZzzz...

I have just made an update the svn, I have add a documentation (note finish) 
for users of the conf file, and I have made little modification on my code 
to increase simplicity to adding futher features.
I actualy begin to comment my code to generate the doxygen's documentation 
for the developpers (you people).

I have done the plant for implement condition expression and loop (for 
futher), I must be able to start to code these features this afternoon. It 
tightened possible to imbricate them between them.

And I must to try clear a little my code, to avoid the redundancy.

Merci, (en francais car je suis vraiment fatigue)

J'ai taffe pas mal ce weekend alors je pense que je vais bien dormir.
J'en ai fait un peu plus que prevu, c'est a dire que les expressions (eval) 
doivent etre entierement operationnelles (je ne vais pas les tester ce soir 
mais il n'y a pas trop de risque). Il y a juste une petite fonction que 
j'avais prevu de faire que je n'ai pas faite, mais bon elle est pas urgente.
Le code actuelle va me permettre de gerer les boucles tres facilement (moins 
de 15 lignes a ajouter).
La facon dont j'ai decoupe la fonction de gestion des evaluations va me 
permettre egalement de d'affecter le resultat a des variables (pratique pour 
gerer les priorites sur les operateur 'and' et 'or').

j'ai aussi commence la doc pour les utilisateurs du fichier de conf et la 
generation avec doxygen (je vais encore rajouter des petits trucs ce soir 
notement le graph)


Je vais egalement reflechir a tout ce qui a rapport aux valeurs par defaut 
(comme remplacer les valeurs incorrectes par celle par defaut), apres ca il 
ne restera vraiment plus grand chose normalement.

Voila bonne nuit a tous.

Message-ID: <af0bb1020511061703r2e6bac84ne02eb2d9298ddb93@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I m developping the spool scheme for the zia server.
According to soutenance feedbacks, the idea of having
one thread managing a limited number of connections through
the mean of io multiplexing works fine.
In our implementation, there will be 100 threads managing 100 connections,
thus a total of 10000 connections.
This scheme is portable, and the implementation is not portable at the
moment
and have to be improved, but the design is fine (more on this later.)

Tomorrow, the spool should be implemented for unix as a test, but won't be
integrated
to the server for the moment.... eventhough it shouldn't be too difficult,
replacing our only
thread by a thread of the spool.

More on that tomorrow, in the night.

Good night,

Texane.

Zia code is in complete rebuilding, so try to not modify the code
the code on the svn! It's very important: NOT FOLLOWING THIS RULE
WILL MAKE THE CODE NOT INTEGRATED TO THE PROJECT!

Hi all,

Next meeting to come has been scheduled to the november, the 14 th (tonight,
as
mentioned on berlios.), let's say 20hoo, as usual.

Today we are to talk about zia migration.
It's very important to be here, a presentation will
be made to expose new ideas and implementation of the
zia server, not yet present on the svn.

We will gather ideas from JP and Xavier work on modules
and cgi scripts, and will see how much Vincent has done on
the logging class.

It's very important to be here since we will see how the source
code will be release on the svn, and who is to make which module,
and issues related to configuration file.

See you tonight,

Fabien.

Hi all,


New sources of the project have been made available on the svn.
The <b>NEW SOURCES TO USE FROM NOW</b> are present
in the <b>branches/ziahttpd-mod/</b> directory.
USE IT for now, older sources are no longer maintained! NO EXCEPTIONS
are allowed, and the code you produce will be discarded if you continue
to use the older src/ directory.

A module creation how to is to be made available tonight in the svn doc/
directory,
so READ IT before doing something else.

If you encountered problems, or have any question, report it on the
mailling as soon as possible.

see you,

Fabien.

Hi all

A very minimalistic file has been release on the svn,
explaining - very briefly - how to develop modules for the zia server.
It's important every one read it since it contains informations about module
programming.
Please report remark, misunderstanding, mistakes... you can find, so that
we will improve this documentation for other people.
This is VERY IMPORTANT.

Have a nice day,

I have find a methode to reduce memory usage by ConfManager :
Now I allocate dynamicly default all values and list of know balises. 
because I think that all default values can take a little high memory. And 
this information are needed only for configuration loading, it's may a 
little slower but it's a better memory usage.

I m working on a basic cgi module that should work,
to retrieve previous server features.

We should build a list of server modules to program,
and assign to a particular person on the task list on berlios.

If somebody is willing to do that task, please post it.

A debugging facitliy has been added to the zia, but is
still IN PROGRESS.
At compile time, if the ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING
macro is defined, it will output to cout stream.
For an example of its usage, ask me, or see the file

modules/net/main.cc
include/debug/debug.hh

If you have any idea to improve it, you are welcome.

Furthermore, the to_string method has been
added to buffer clas, so that you can stringify
buffers and print them in nice ways (parametrable).

Have a nice night,

Hi all,

As we can see, there are some (minimalistic) problems in the developement
effort, due to bottleneck(goulo d etrangelement in french).
So it's not bad, and even normal in computer programming projects, but we
have to solve it.
So today is dedicated to that.
At the end of the morning, the configuration file should be integrated to
the project.
At the end of the day, the looping problem of the server should be "solved",
in order
for Mat(and actually every one else) to develop more easily. This would be
nice if
all module use the new io scheme, that's now part of the api (callback
registering +
io operations services.)
Today, we also have to plan a meeting that should take place 10 days at
least before
the first defence.

So see you today,

Fabien.

Subject: [Ziahttpd-developers] News for the project
Message-ID: <af0bb1020511250757n4f8d96a6u8798861c3ff6a941@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Some news from the front ;)
So the api, as it is implemented by now, is to work great.
The only think is to rebuild some part, but we will see later.
The ssl module is concerned by that, so come to see me
when you can.
Concerning the module resource, mat wil reimplement it later.
I will redact the draft for our api today, in english, so somebody
has to translate it into french, and format the paper to make
it more presentable to others (Vincent's role).
Concerning the api, Crivis and consort group don't seem
involved in the project(en gros ils sont la pour poser des questions (sur le
projet
ou non), mais pas pour participer; au developement de l api), so for the
moment they don't know anything about the recent and very important changes
made...

So let's working and see at the beginning of the next week, where we
should have a more complete draft.
We will present the problems involved in the server, that's important
for you to dev the ssl module.

By,

Fabien.
